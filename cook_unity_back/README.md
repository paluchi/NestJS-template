# Subscriptions Service API

## Overview

The Subscriptions Service API is an integral part of a food service platform that allows two primary user types—interns and regular users—to register, log in, and interact with meal-related services. Interns can browse a general menu, while regular users have the ability to subscribe to meals and provide ratings for them.

## Endpoints

### Intern Endpoints

- **POST `/intern/auth/register`**: Allows new interns to create an account within the application.
- **POST `/intern/auth/login`**: Interns use this endpoint to log into their account.
- **GET `/intern/menu`**: Retrieves the general menu available to all interns.
- **PUT `/intern/menu`**: (Assuming this is for updating the menu) Allows authorized personnel to update the general menu items.

### User Endpoints

- **POST `/user/auth/register`**: Enables new users to register on the platform.
- **POST `/user/auth/login`**: Provides a login endpoint for registered users.
- **GET `/user/subscriptions/meals`**: Fetches all meals that a user is currently subscribed to, along with meal details and chef information.
- **PUT `/user/subscriptions/rate_meal`**: Allows users to rate a meal they are subscribed to for feedback and personalization purposes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Separate registration and login processes for interns and regular users.
- **Menu Access**: Differentiated menu viewing capabilities for interns and regular users.
- **Meal Subscription and Feedback**: Exclusive to regular users, providing them with the ability to subscribe and rate meals, enhancing the personalization of the service.

## What Can Be Improved

### Enhanced Authentication Gateways

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Introduce a two-step verification process for added security.
- **OAuth Integration**: Allow users to authenticate using other credentials such as Google, Facebook, or Apple IDs for a more streamlined sign-in process.
- **Token Refresh Mechanisms**: Implement refresh tokens to keep users logged in securely without asking for credentials repeatedly.

### Routing and Authorization Enhancements

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Establish roles such as 'user', 'chef', 'admin', etc., to manage access control throughout the API more effectively.
- **Private Routing by Default**: Adopt a 'secure by default' stance by making all routes private unless explicitly defined as public. This ensures that new endpoints are secure from inception.
- **Endpoint Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests that can be made to the endpoints within a certain timeframe.

### Code Quality and Maintenance

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement a robust logging system to record user actions, exceptions, and system behavior for easier debugging and analysis.
- **Automated Testing**: Expand unit and integration testing coverage to ensure reliability and faster iteration cycles.

### Scalability and Performance

- **Caching Strategies**: Utilize caching for meal data to improve response times and reduce database load.
- **Database Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize database queries and indices for performance efficiency.

### User Experience

- **Personalized Meal Recommendations**: Use machine learning algorithms to suggest meals to users based on their rating history and preferences.
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Implement interactive API documentation with Swagger UI or similar tools for real-time testing and exploration of API endpoints.

### Compliance and Security

- **Data Privacy Compliance**: Ensure the service adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

By continually evolving the service with these improvements, the company can maintain a competitive edge, ensure customer satisfaction, and uphold the highest security standards.

### Why I choosed prisma?

Prisma is employed in our service architecture for several compelling reasons:

- **Ease of Use**: Prisma provides an auto-generated and type-safe query builder which is easy to use. It simplifies database workflows and reduces the potential for error in complex queries.
- **Type Safety**: With Prisma, the database schema is mapped to TypeScript types. This ensures that any discrepancies between the code and the database schema can be caught at compile time, making the code more robust and reliable.
- **Migrations Made Simple**: Prisma Migrations allow us to evolve the database schema with ease. The migrations are declarative and can be version-controlled, which simplifies deployment and rollback processes.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Prisma's intuitive data modeling and auto-completion features significantly enhance developer productivity and experience.
- **Performance**: Prisma optimizes database access at build time, which can lead to better performance in production.
- **Community and Support**: Prisma has a strong community and is backed by excellent documentation and support, ensuring that any issues can be quickly addressed.
- **Versatility**: It supports various databases, giving us the flexibility to adapt to different storage requirements as needed.

By leveraging Prisma, we aim to streamline our database operations, reduce development time, and create a more maintainable codebase.
